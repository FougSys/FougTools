 * \brief Computes all the indexes of a grid's cells
 *
 * The result is an array of grid rows (each row being of the same size).\n
 * For example:
 *   \li GridNumbering(Qt::TopRightCorner, Qt::Vertical, GridNumbering::OneWay)
 *   \li rowCount = colCount = 4
 *   \li startIndex = 0
 *
 * will output:
 * \code
 *   row[0] == { 12   8  4  0 }
 *   row[1] == { 13   9  5  1 }
 *   row[2] == { 14  10  6  2 }
 *   row[3] == { 15  11  7  3 }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \note Let N = \p rowCount and M = \p colCount , complexity is O(NxM)
 *
 * \param gridNb How grid cells have to be numbered
 * \param rowCount Count of rows in the grid
 * \param colCount Count of columns in the grid
 * \param startIndex The first index to start from (usually 0 or 1)
