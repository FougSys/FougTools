/*!
 * \class BasicSharedPointer
 * \brief Provides basic sharing of a pointer
 *
 * BasicSharedPointer is an automatic, shared pointer in C++. It behaves exactly like a normal
 * pointer for normal purposes, including respect for constness.
 *
 * BasicSharedPointer will delete the pointer it is holding when it goes out of scope, provided no
 * other BasicSharedPointer objects are referencing it.
 *
 * "Basic" means that there is no thread-safety or any sophisticated management. It aims to stay
 * light for simple uses.
