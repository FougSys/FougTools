\section intro_sec INTRODUCTION

This is FougTools v0.5

Check source code at : https://github.com/fougsys/fougtools

FougTools is a collection of utility tools for the C++ language, Qt and 
Open Cascade toolkits.


\section build_sec BUILDING FougTools
Create a file named _local_config.pri in the folder where FougTools will
be built and define the following variables, depending on your needs:
\code
  # Everything will be installed here :
  PREFIX_DIR = /opt/lib/fougtools/qt5-build

  # If you want to build occtools (optional)
  CONFIG += occtools  

  # Path to root directory of OpenCascade
  CASCADE_ROOT = /path/to/opencascade/build
\endcode

Or use Ruby script qmake/configure.rb, print help with:
\code
  ruby $FOUGTOOLS/qmake/configure.rb -h
\endcode

Note that on Windows, qmake complains about deprecated support of
backslash '\' characters.
So you may have to escape backslashes like C:\\path\\to\\opencascade
or simply use Unix separators instead C:/path/to/opencascade

Once configuration is done, then type: 
\code
  qmake -r $FOUGTOOLS/qmake/fougtools.pro
  (n)make
  (n)make install
\endcode


\section reportbug_sec HOW TO REPORT A BUG

If you think you have found a bug in FougTools, we would like to hear
about it so that we can fix it. The FougTools bug tracking system is
open to the public at https://github.com/fougsys/fougtools/issues.

Before reporting a bug, please use the bug-tracker's search functions
to see if the issue is already known.

Always include the following information in your bug report: the name
and version number of your compiler; the name and version number of
your operating system; the version of FougTools you are using, and
what configure options it was compiled with.

If the problem you are reporting is only visible at run-time, try to
create a small test program that shows the problem when run.

\section codingstyle_sec CODING STYLE

The coding style is borrowed from Qt-Creator:
  http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/qtcreator-extending/coding-style.html

With these exceptions:
  \li Formatting/Whitespace: two spaces instead of four
  \li Formatting/Capitalizing Identifiers: namespace names begin with a lower case letter
  \li Use this pattern for pimpl class:
       \code
       class Foo
       {
       public:
         Foo();
         // API ...

       private:
         class Private;
         Private* const d;
       };
       \endcode
       This has the advantage to not have to forward declare the Private class outside Foo
